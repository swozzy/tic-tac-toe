Welcome to User Documentation!
This wiki contains information on how to play the game.
Before we start, make sure you have read the readme file and have all prerequisites ready.
- First, you should run the main.py file in the tic-tac-toe folder to start game.
- It will ask you whether you want to hear the rules of the game or not. Input should be one of the followings:"yes", "ye", "y", "ya", "yea", "yeah", "yup";"no", "n", "nah", "na" in either letter case. Space is not expected in the input. There will be an error message if the input is not recognized.
- After reading/skipping the rules, the game will then ask you about player names. Player name can be any string (space letters is fine)
- The program will randomly decide the order of the player i.e. who goes first. And it will prompt a message to let you know.
- The player who goes first (say player 1) can choose which symbol she/he wants. Either X or O. Input should be X or O in either case. Space is not expected.
- Player 1 can choose the first spot now. The board is assigned with indexes 1-9. Each number corresponds to a spot. Read from left to right and top to bottom.
- Once a player has chosen a spot, the board will be refreshed and the chosen spot will be occupied by the player's symbol. The user is expected to input numbers ONLY, and cannot reoccupy a spot. The program will also prompt error messages if any of these happens.
- The game will end if any one of the players wins, or if there is a tie. User is not expected to quit in the middle of the game.

- After a game has ended, the program will ask if you want to play again. Input should be one of the followings:"yes", "ye", "y", "ya", "yea", "yeah", "yup";"no", "n", "nah", "na" in either letter case. Space is not expected in the input. There will be an error message if the input is not recognized.

If you choose to play again, the game will start with prompting if you want to hear rules of the game, if you choose not to start a new game, the program will end.
If you choose to play again, the game will start with prompting if you want to hear rules of the game, if you choose not to start a new game, the program will end.
