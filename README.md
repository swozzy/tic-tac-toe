# SETTING IT ALL UP

### Prerequesites
* #### Checking Python version
In order to ensure proper gameplay, we suggest having the most up-to-date version (3.9.0+) of Python installed. Please see the steps below for making sure that this version is installed. 

1. Open a terminal
2. Type ```python --version```
3. Press Enter. The terminal should print which version of Python you have installed. Please make sure that the version number is 3.9.0 or higher. If you have an older version of Python installed, please see the "Installing Python" subsection underneath "Setting Up."

__WARNING__: Not having the most recent version installed may cause bugs, errors, and failure in starting the application.

* #### Libraries Used

![Pylint](images/pylint.png)

  [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) is a "Python static code analysis tool which looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard, sniffs for code smells and offers simple refactoring suggestions." This library helped us to build you this wonderful game and, if you decide to branch it for yourself, we suggest you use it aswell!
  
![Pytest](images/pytest.png)

  [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) is "a framework that makes building simple and scalable tests easy." Please make sure this library is installed if you would like to perform tests on our code.

### Setting Up

* #### Downloading Github Code
  1. You're probably in this repository already, but if not, please follow this link: https://github.com/swozzy/tic-tac-toe/tree/main
  2. Click the green " â¬‡ Code" button
  3. Download the repository as a ZIP file. It should be called "tic-tac-toe-main"
  4. Open the folder that contains the ZIP file. Extract the ZIP files to that folder
  5. You should see a folder called "tic-tac-toe-main". We will use the terminal to get to the main.py function and execute it in the section below called "Running the Game."
  
  
  __NOTE (1)__: Location of main function (after downloading and extracting): C:\...\FOLDER_EXTRACTED_TO\tic-tac-toe-main\methods_and_classes\**main.py**
  
  __NOTE (2)__: There are no branches besides the ```main``` branch, so please use that one.
